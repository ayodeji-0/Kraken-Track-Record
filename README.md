ROE and PnL graphics from leveraged crypto positions.

**Disclaimer** Contents of this repo are handpicked wins and do not reflect my overall win-rate... which is slightly positive c.62% wr with most trades taken with a 3:1 risk-reward ratio so 25% wr needed to break even, hence profitability 🤑.

They are just for proof that I have some "skin in the game" i.e., personal experience systematically trading with my own money. I also hold an indexed portfolio on a separate account which returned c.140% over H2 24, mostly due to the trump driven bull run in the last quarter.
I started trading because it represented a less random form of livebetting...lol... I literally used to live bet on league of legends games when I was 14/15 (21 now) so yea...made money tho, then lost it gambling on csgo cases :(.


But with trading assets, the amount of historical data that you have access to is orders of magnitudes higher than the information available about league of legends team and individual player stats, hence more conclusive evidence can be found through data analysis.


I trade mostly on raw price action (short term/intra-day) and mean reversion/moving average crossovers (long term/swing trading); backtested both of these with quantstats and got sensible results over multiple timeframes before employing them with real money.

I have plans to extend valuation analysis to calculating the value/prices of cryptocurrencies using bitcoin-proxy/correlation values and discounted utility models (market cap, fear-greed indexes etc.), sine they generally have no intrinsic value.

My current philosophy around day trading is mostly momentum based and can be termed "omega-scalping", basically wait for price trends to fully form (tracking supply and demand/support and resistance levels) then following the masses, in short buy high sell higher (longs) and sell low buy lower (shorts). I also sit down to assess my failed trades and understand what was wrong with my thought process (hindishgt risk assessment basically) instead of brushing them off and calling myself the crypto cohen/livermore (dont plan on killing myself anytime soon).

These short positions are from the aftermath of the trump inspired bull run Q424 using leverage to amplify profits as I was pretty convinced everything was overvalued.
