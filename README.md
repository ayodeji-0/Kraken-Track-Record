# Kraken-Track-Record

ROE and PnL graphics from leveraged crypto positions.

**Disclaimer** Contents of this repo are handpicked wins and do not reflect my overall win-rate...which is overall positive c.62% all time
I trade mostly on price action (short term) and mean reversion (long term) since calculating the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies is difficult at best and fantasy at worst.
These short positions are from the aftermath of the trunp inspired bull run Q424.
