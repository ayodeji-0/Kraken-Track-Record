ROE and PnL graphics from leveraged crypto positions.

62% wr, 3:1 risk-reward ratio.

personal experience systematically trading with my own money. hold an indexed portfolio on a separate account which returned c.140% over H2 24, mostly due to the trump driven bull run in the last quarter.

with trading assets the amount of historical data that you have access to is high (higher than league of legends player stats), conclusive evidence can be found through data analysis.

I trade mostly on raw price action (short term/intra-day) and mean reversion/moving average crossovers (long term/swing trading) to confirm when entry or exit points backed by event driven philosophies; backtested both of these with quantstats and got sensible results over multiple timeframes before employing them with real money.

I also sit down to assess my failed trades and understand what was wrong with my thought process (hindishgt risk assessment basically) instead of brushing them off and calling myself the crypto cohen/livermore (dont plan on killing myself anytime soon - livermore died by suicide...).

These short positions are from the aftermath of the trump inspired bull run Q424 using leverage to amplify profits as I was pretty convinced everything was overvalued).
