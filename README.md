# Kraken-Track-Record

ROE and PnL graphics from leveraged crypto positions.

**Disclaimer** Contents of this repo are handpicked wins and do not reflect my overall win-rate... which is slightly positive.
They are just for proof that I have some "skin in the game" i.e., personal experience with systematic trading.


I trade mostly on price action (short term) and mean reversion (long term) since calculating the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies is difficult at best and fantasy at worst.
These short positions are from the aftermath of the trunp inspired bull run Q424.
