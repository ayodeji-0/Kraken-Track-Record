# Kraken-Track-Record

ROE and PnL graphics from leveraged crypto positions.

**Disclaimer** Contents of this repo are handpicked wins and do not reflect my overall win-rate... which is slightly positive.
They are just for proof that I have some "skin in the game" i.e., personal experience with systematic trading with my own money.
I started trading as a less random form of livebetting...lol... I literally used to live bet on leauge of legends games when I was 16 so yea...made money tho, then lost it on csgo :(


I trade mostly on price action (short term) and mean reversion (long term) since calculating the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies is difficult at best and fantasy at worst; backtested both of these with quantstats and got sensible results.
My current philosophy around day trading is mostly momentum based and can be termed "omega-scalping", basically wait for price trends to fully form then follow the masses, in short buy high sell higher (longs) and sell low buy lower (shorts).

These short positions are from the aftermath of the trunp inspired bull run Q424.
