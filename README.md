ROE and PnL graphics from leveraged crypto positions.

**Disclaimer** Contents of this repo are handpicked wins and do not reflect my overall win-rate... which is slightly positive c.62% wr with most trades balancing out to a 3:1 risk-reward ratio so risk-adjusted wr is c.24%.

They are just for proof that I have some "skin in the game" i.e., personal experience with systematic trading with my own money.
I started trading because it represented a less random form of livebetting...lol... I literally used to live bet on league of legends games when I was 16 (21 now) so yea...made money tho, then lost it on csgo cases :(.
But with trading assets the historical data that you have access to is orders of magnitudes higher than the information available about league of legends team and individual player stats, hence more conclusive evidence can be found in data.


I trade mostly on price action (short term/intra-day) and mean reversion (long term/swing trading),backtested both of these with quantstats and got sensible results, with plans to extend valuation analysis to calculating the prices of cryptocurrencies using bitcoin-proxy/correlation values and discounted utility models, sine they generally have no intrinsic value.


My current philosophy around day trading is mostly momentum based and can be termed "omega-scalping", basically wait for price trends to fully form then follow the masses, in short buy high sell higher (longs) and sell low buy lower (shorts). I also sit down to assess my failed trades and understand what was wrong with my thought process instead of calling myself the crypto cohen/livermore.

These short positions are from the aftermath of the trump inspired bull run Q424 using leverage to amplify profits.
